## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files

- **index.html:** This file will serve as the main landing page for the application. It will contain the primary content, including text and images, and a call-to-action.

### Routes

1. **@app.route('/')**
   - This route will map to the 'index.html' file and render the landing page.

### Example

```python
# Import Flask
from flask import Flask, render_template

# Create a Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Define the route for the landing page
@app.route('/')
def index():
    """Render the landing page."""
    return render_template('index.html')

# Run the app
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Additional Notes

- The 'debug=True' parameter in the 'app.run()' method is used for development purposes and should be set to 'False' for production environments.
- The design assumes a simple landing page with basic text and image content. Additional features or functionalities can be added as needed.
